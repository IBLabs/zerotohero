# Niran: Zero to Hero

Welcome to Niran's "Zero to Hero" exercise! We're going to get you from a simple Python student to an awesome developer in no-time! Provided you follow the instructions and stay motivated!

## Assignment 1: Capital Cities

In this 1st assignment we are going to familiar with some basic real-world python programming! We are going to create a script that fetches the list of the world's capital cities, does some manipulations and creates a new JSON file that contains the new modified values.

### Prerequisites

These are the things you need to know before starting this assignment -

  * **HTTP Requests**
    * What is an HTTP request?
    * What are the different types of HTTP requests? (GET, POST etc.)
    * Specifically, what is a **POST** request?
    * Specifically, what is a **GET** request?
    * What is the difference between GET and POST requests? [Read More](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp)
  * **JSON**
    * What is JSON? [Read More](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_intro.asp)
    * What is the structure of a JSON object?
  * **Python File Manipulation**
    * How do you **create** a text file in python? [Read More](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48959098/how-to-create-a-new-text-file-using-python)

    * How do you **rename** a file in python [Read More](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2491222/how-to-rename-a-file-using-python)
  * **Python Packages**
    * What is PIP? [Read More](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_pip.asp)
  * **Python HTTP Requests**
    * Get to know the **Requests** python library [Read More](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
      * How do you install the Requests library? (*hint: use* `pip`)
      * How do you perform a simple GET request?
      * How do you perform a simple POST request?

### Objective

Create a script that connects to the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/) and requests the list of the world's countries. After receiving the list, the script will **add 1 key-value pair** to each one of the returned countries' JSON dictionaries in the following format:

    "flag_url": "[THE_FLAG_URL]"

Where `[THE_FLAG_URL]` is an actual URL address of a PNG file of the country's flag - you can use [Country Flags API](https://countryflags.io/) to get the images of the countries' flags.

#### What Should I Do?

Now we will list the steps you should perform to create the following script, make sure to follow the instructions slowly, and if you get stuck, just give me a call!

  * ~~**Step 1:** Create a python script that requests the list of countries from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu/) and prints it to the console~~
  * **Step 2:** Coming soon...
